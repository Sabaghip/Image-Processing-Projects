## Features

- **Spatial Operations**: Basic image manipulations such as resizing, cropping, and filtering.
- **Fourier Transform**: Frequency domain analysis using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).
- **Morphological Operations**: Techniques such as erosion, dilation, opening, and closing.
- **Image Restoration**: Methods to restore images affected by blurring and noise.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib

## Installation

To get started with this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required libraries using pip

## Usage

You can read project instructions for each sub-project from pdf files and run .ipynb files


## Examples

Here are some examples of the operations implemented in this project:

1. **Spatial Filtering**: 
   - Apply a Gaussian blur to an image.
   
2. **Fourier Transform**: 
   - Analyze the frequency components of an image.
   
3. **Morphological Operations**: 
   - Perform erosion and dilation on binary images.

4. **Image Restoration**: 
   - Restore a blurred image using Wiener filtering.
